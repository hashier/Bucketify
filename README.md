This will be a Swiss knife for Spotify's playlists. You can sort your playlists by country (which country the artist is from), year or genre. More to come if I you have any ideas drop me a line.

Only available for iOS 7.


# Features

* Filter "Starred" playlist by country of artist
* Count items in playlist
* Randomise playlist (Spotifys random seems sometimes not random enough to me)


## Planned features

* Filter playlist by genre
* Filter playlist by year
* Filter playlist by mood
* Filter playlist by BMP (beats per minute)
* Backup playlist
* Restore playlist
* Backup all playlists
* Restore all playlists
* Generate playlist with all songs from all playlists

Just let me know if you have any requests or ideas.
