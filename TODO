* Filter playlist by genre
* Filter playlist by year
* Filter playlist by mood
* Filter playlist by BMP (beats per minute)


# Utilities

* Count (how many songs are there in the playlist?)
* Backup playlist
* Restore playlist
* Randomise playlist (Spotifys random seems sometimes not random enough to me)
